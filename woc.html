            Wells-Barnett was a prominent journalist, activist, and researcher,
            in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In her lifetime, she
            battled sexism, racism, and violence. As a skilled writer,
            Wells-Barnett also used her skills as a journalist to shed light on
            the conditions of African Americans throughout the South.

          <h3>(Isabella Bomfree) Sojourner Truth</h3>
          <p>
            Formerly enslaved, Sojourner Truth became an outspoken advocate for
            abolition, temperance, and civil and women’s rights in the
            nineteenth century. She challenged the notions of racial and gender
            inferiority through notable speeches and a lecture tour, including
            “Ain’t I A Woman?” Her work to help formerly enslaved peoples find
            jobs and build new lives after the Civil War earned her an
            invitation to meet President Abraham Lincoln in 1864.

            Born in 1896 in Guangzhou, China, Lee moved to the US at the age of
            4 and became a key part of the suffragette movement where she
            mobilized the Chinese-American community to support women’s right to
            vote despite the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred any voting
            rights. It is still unknown whether Lee ever was able to cast her
            ballot.

            supporting the revolution in Mexico. In 1911, Idár and her family

            border to fight injustice. She was known for saying, “when you
            educate a woman, you educate a family.”
