          Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, is an
          annual holiday celebrated on June 19th. The holiday commemorates the
          emancipation of enslaved African Americans and serves as a day of
          reflection and celebration of freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          On June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston,
          Texas, and announced General Order No. 3, which proclaimed the freedom
          of enslaved people in Texas, making them the last group of slaves to
          be emancipated in the United States. This announcement came more than
          two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President
          Abraham Lincoln in 1863.

          Juneteenth is often marked by various events and activities
          highlighting African American history and culture. These include
          parades, festivals, picnics, barbecues, music performances,
          educational programs, and community gatherings. It is a time for
          reflection on the struggles and achievements of African Americans
          throughout history, as well as a celebration of the principles of
          freedom, equality, and unity.
        </p>
        <br />

          Recently, there has been a growing movement to recognize Juneteenth as
          a national holiday. On June 17, 2021, it was officially declared a
          federal holiday in the United States when President Joe Biden signed
          the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law. This
          designation acknowledges the historical significance of Juneteenth and
          its importance in the country's ongoing journey toward racial equality
          and justice.
